  <h1>Difference between Local and Session storage</h1>
  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It never expires on closing tab or browser</li>
    <li>It takes 5-10Mbs memory</li>
    <li>It is accessible to all windows.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Session Storage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It expires on closing tab</li>
    <li>It takes 5Mbs memory</li>
    <li>It is accessible to all tab</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Difference between Local and Global Scope</h1>
  <p><b>Global scope:</b>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply
    consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure
    that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the
    code.</p>
  <p><b>Local Scope:</b> Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A
    local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.</p>
  <h1>How does event loop work</h1>
  <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single
    thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at
    what happens on the back-end.</p>
  <p>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function
    is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
  <p>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data
    structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>
  <h1>How can be made undfined in javascript</h1>
  <h2>Undefined can be found in many ways, few example are mentioned here</h2>
  <p>
    let count;<br>
    count; // => <b>here it will be undefined</b><br>
    let person = { name: 'Abul' };<br>
    person.id; // => <b>here it will be undefined</b><br>
    let movies = ['Hawa', 'Agun'];<br>
    movies[3]; // => <b>here it will be undefined</b><br>
    let testVar = undefined;<br>
    console.log(testVar); // => <b>here it will be undefined</b><br>
  </p>
